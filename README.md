# Planit

An application to assist high school students with planning their assignments

To run the server:

1. Ensure you have the latest version of nodejs installed.
2. Clone the repository
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `node server.js` to start the server.

Once the server is running, you can connect to the application at localhost:8080


Don't forget to view the application in the mobile view on chrome!
