# Planit

An application to assist high school students with planning their assignments.

Live Version: [http://planit-444.herokuapp.com/](http://planit-444.herokuapp.com/)

To run the server:

1. Ensure you have the latest version of nodejs installed.
2. Clone the repository
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `node server.js` to start the server.

Once the server is running, you can connect to the application at localhost:8080


Don't forget to view the application in the mobile view on chrome!
To do this, press F12 in Google chrome. Then, click on the "toggle device toolbar" button. Then, on the top of the device view, select a device such as Galaxy S5 (you can pick anything but responsive)


For those unfamiliar with angular or ui.router, here's a wiki post I made detailing how to go about adding a new page:
